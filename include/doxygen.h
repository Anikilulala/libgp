\mainpage libgp - A Gaussian Process library for Machine Learning

\section about About
libgp is a C++ library for Gaussian Process regression. More information on Gaussian processes can be found in the book
<a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/" target="_blank">Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</a> by 
Carl Edward Rasmussen and Christopher K. I. Williams which is available for 
<a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters">download</a> in electronic format.

\section requirements Requirements
- libgp was tested under Linux and MacOSX
- <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_blank">cmake</a>: cross-platform, open-source build system
- <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org" target="_blank">Eigen3</a>: template library for linear algebra
- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest" target="_blank">googletest</a> (optional)

\section start Getting started
-# <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libgp/files/">Download</a>  the latest version of libgp 
and unpack the archive.
-# Create a build directory in the project folder, run cmake and make.
\verbatim mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make\endverbatim
-# Check out this @ref gp_example.cc "example" on how to use the library.
